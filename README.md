# Samsung-SmartTag-Hack

Besides the firmware dump, I have placed enough info about: PCB, MCU, PockeGlitcher, timings, etc... to be able to replicate the Fault Injection attack and permanently disable your Samsung SmartTag too.

Happy Hacking!

#### Disclaimer, before I get a Cease & Desist letter from mama Samsung:
The dump has been released for the sole scope of entertaining fellow hacker inr everse engineering it.
Do not blame me for publishing it, blame yourself for not having done the proper homeworks during R&D, before picking a vulnerable MCU to Fault Injection Attacks. â™¥
